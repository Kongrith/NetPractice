# NetPractice

## 📖 Description

NetPractice is an introductory simulation project designed to help students understand the fundamentals of computer networks through 10-level practices. The project focuses network configuration problems that focus on TCP/IP addressing with IPv4.

Using a browser-based training interface, the goal is to fix non-functioning network diagrams by correctly configuring parameters such as IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways. The networks are not real, but they behave like real-world networking environments.

By completing this project, students gain a practical understanding of how devices communicate within a network and how routing works.

## 🚀 Instructions

1. **A modern web browser**

```bash
⚠️ Google Chrome or any Chromium-based browser is recommended
⚠️ Firefox may not work properly with the interface
```

2. **Download official web-based simulator**

```bash
Step1: donwload it at netpractice project or below path:
https://cdn.intra.42.fr/document/document/43640/net_practice.1.8.tgz

Step2: unzip it. You can see these files.

```

3. **Start Trainning/Evaluation**

```bash
Step1: Find index.html and open with browser.

Step2: Selection your choices i.e., Training, Evaluation.

Step3: Input your infra-login name.

Step4: Enjoy Trainning/Evaluation. If configuration is correct, the 'Next level' button appear.
```

4. **Exporting Trainning**

```bash
Find 'Get my config' button. Push it, the json file is downloaded.
```
